# Netfillet


Netfillet is a relational database system to support the operations of an on-line movie rental system, along the lines of netflix.com. 
Netfillet uses HTML for the user interface, for the database server, and Java, Javascript, and JDBC for connectivity between the user interface and database server.


Basic idea
--------

The basic idea behind Netfillet on-line movie rental system is that it will allow customers to use the web to browse/search the contents of your database (at least that part you want the customer to see) and to rent movies over the web. 
In this regard, it is a lot like the on-line movie rental web sites Netflix and Amazon Video.
